# Submitting a Model to the Leaderboard

If your model belongs to one of the classes below, raise a request on the leaderboard submit section.
1. HuggingFace encoder model - in essence, token classifiers
2. HuggingFace decoder model - autoregressive LMs, these also need a prompt template
3. GLiNER based model

If your model does not belong to the classes above, you can add a [custom model implementation] with a PR or raise a request with the NCER team.
